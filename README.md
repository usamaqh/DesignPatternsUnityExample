Hey! I am Usama Qureshi, a passionate Unity Game and AR/VR Developer with over seven years of professional experience creating innovative, immersive games, apps, and experiences. 

I've led multiple teams, conducted code reviews, and interviewed game developers. Many of them say they know their design patterns, but they're hesitant to apply them in their code, which often ends up being pretty messy. Some have also mentioned that they donâ€™t fully understand where to apply certain patterns because there aren't enough game related examples out there.
So, my motivation for creating this project is to help game developers better understand useful design patterns and their use cases, through interactive examples. I've tried to keep it as simple as possible and added tutorial docs for each pattern.

I have covered few of the most important Design Patterns used in game dev, namely Singleton, State Machine, Observer and Command Patterns. Will try to add in more useful patterns in the future.
Feel free to test it out and let me know if you have any feedback, suggestions, or anything you'd like me to fix!
